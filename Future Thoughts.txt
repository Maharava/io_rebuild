# Io Wake Word Detection Engine - To Do List

## Critical Bugs

1. **Rename Non-Standard `init.py` Files**
   - Change all `init.py` files to the standard `__init__.py` in:
     - `src/io_wake_word/audio/init.py`
     - `src/io_wake_word/utils/init.py`
     - `src/io_wake_word/models/init.py`
     - `src/io_wake_word/diagnostics/init.py`
     - `src/io_wake_word/cli/init.py`
   - Update imports in affected files

2. **Remove Duplicated `load_model` Function**
   - In `src/io_wake_word/models/architecture.py` there are two implementations of `load_model`
   - Keep the more robust version and remove the duplicate

3. **Add Missing Import in `utils/actions.py`**
